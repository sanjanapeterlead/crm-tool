| Ad-spend / ROI | v2 | new adapter + table beside `meta_lead_attribution` |
| Auto-create a lead from an inbound WhatsApp (click-to-WhatsApp ads) | v2 | `handleInbound` "unmatched" branch → `captureLead` |
| Per-salesperson calendars | v2 | `CalendarConnection` already carries a connection id |
| DaySchedule / Calendly API | v2 | new `CalendarProvider` |
| Multiple pipelines per org | v2 | `pipelines` table exists; needs UI |
| Custom fields, vertical templates | v3 | — |

## Known limitations of V1

- One WhatsApp number and one Google account **per organization** (shared
  business number; the meeting owner is the connected account).
- Inbound WhatsApp from an unknown number is logged as *unmatched*, not turned
  into a lead.
- Kanban drag-and-drop is mouse-only (the Change Stage dialog is the accessible
  path).
- No CSP header yet; no MFA (see `docs/security.md`).
- Meta long-lived tokens are not proactively refreshed.
